1.  Create a C# Console application.

2.  Within the Main() method in this application, create variables of the correct data type for the information related to a student only.  The other information will be used in later modules when you create class files for the other objects listed:

Student Information

First Name Last Name Birthdate Address Line 1 Address Line 2 City State/Province Zip/Postal Country 

3.  Once you have the variables created, use assignment statements to assign values to one set of student variables and use the Console.WriteLine() method to output the values to the console window.

Again, this assignment is merely intended to check your understanding of how to create variables, assign values to them, and output the information to a console window.  You will build on these concepts and begin to create more functionality in later modules.

4.  Post your code in the peer review area for feedback from other students.
